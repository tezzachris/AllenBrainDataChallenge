There are two scripts in the R language:   
DataAnalysis.R  
Model.R  

which carry out the data analysis, the HMM model with the binning.

The model_kf.m is a MATLAB script for calculating the (prediction error decomposition) likelihood function. This function is optimized in the main.m  file for a given set of paramters (the convergence is fast and reliable for a neuron).
